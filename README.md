# HireWow - Decentralized Hiring Portal for Gig Workers

**HireWow** is a decentralized platform designed to revolutionize the gig economy by simplifying the hiring process and ensuring timely payment for gig workers. Built on Bitcoin and powered by BOB (Bitcoin Onboarding Bot), HireWow abstracts the complexity of blockchain technology, making it easy for employees and gig workers to engage in efficient, secure, and trustless transactions.

## Key Features

- **Simplified Onboarding**: Employers only need to purchase Bitcoin to get started. The rest is handled by BOB, our onboarding bot, which abstracts all the complexities of interacting with the blockchain.
- **Job Postings Made Easy**: The smart contract allows employers to create job postings, pick workers, and manage their workforce on demand.
- **Scalable Workforce**: Employers can scale their workforce as needed, whether expanding quickly for short-term projects or shrinking it as demands decrease.
- **Timely Payments**: Solves the problem of gig workers not being paid or facing delayed payments. Payments are handled securely through the BOB network, with the terms enforced by smart contracts.
- **Trustless Contracts**: HireWow uses decentralized smart contracts to manage job terms and payments, ensuring fairness for both employers and gig workers.

## How It Works

1. **Start with Bitcoin**: Employers simply buy Bitcoin to fund their HireWow account. This is the only requirement to get started.
2. **BOB Handles the Rest**: Once Bitcoin is acquired, BOB takes over, abstracting away the technical details.
3. **Smart Contracts for Jobs**: Employers can create job postings that detail the work required, deadlines, and payment terms. Gig workers can then apply for these jobs.
4. **Secure Payments**: Payments are locked into a smart contract, ensuring gig workers are paid as soon as the work is completed, eliminating the risk of non-payment or late payment.

## Benefits

- **For Employers**:

  - Quick and easy workforce management with the ability to scale on demand.
  - Transparent, trustless agreements with workers.
  - Lower overhead for managing payments and contracts.

- **For Gig Workers**:
  - No worries about delayed or missed payments.
  - Fair contracts, enforced by the blockchain.
  - Easy access to job opportunities from decentralized employers.

## To be continued

This project was started during the Encode Bangkok Bitcoin Hackathon. It was all built in the 24 hours allocated, while managing other events.
There are numerous technical improvements to be made in the future for the full fledged product, and this repository serves only as a proof of concept.
